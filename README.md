SYSTEM DESCRIPTION.

Campus Incident Reporting and Responding System is a user-driven platform that enables students and staff to report and track campus-related incidents efficiently. The system provides an intuitive interface where users can submit incident reports, view updates, and follow up on resolutions. It features role-based access control, allowing administrators to review and manage reports while ensuring data integrity and security. Since it is not automated, all updates and responses rely on manual user input, ensuring transparency and accountability in handling incidents. The system is designed to enhance campus safety by fostering direct communication and organized incident management
